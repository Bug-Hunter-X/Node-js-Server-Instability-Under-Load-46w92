# Node.js Server Instability Under Load

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js applications: instability under heavy load. The provided `server.js` showcases a simple HTTP server.  However, this server may fail to handle a large number of concurrent requests gracefully.

The `serverSolution.js` provides a possible solution by incorporating techniques to address the load issues.

## Problem
The original server lacks proper error handling and resource management. This leads to potential issues such as:

* **Unhandled exceptions:** Errors during request processing may not be properly caught, leading to the server crashing.
* **Memory leaks:**  Improper resource cleanup can lead to memory exhaustion.
* **Performance bottlenecks:**  Inefficient code can slow down the server under load, leading to poor response times or timeouts.

## Solution
The improved `serverSolution.js` demonstrates a robust and scalable server by implementing:

* **Error handling:**  Using `try...catch` blocks to prevent unhandled exceptions.
* **Resource cleanup:**  Ensuring that resources (like connections and streams) are properly closed.
* **Asynchronous operations:** Using asynchronous functions or libraries to handle requests concurrently without blocking the event loop.
* **Load balancing (if needed):** Using clustering or other techniques to distribute load across multiple processes.
